PROJECT ALASKA, FREE AND OPEN SOURCE WEB SYSTEM

This is the official development repository for Project Alaska, a free and open source
web system written in PHP.

The project will remain to be actively maintained and supported, and will
stay open to everyone for an indefinite amount of time. We kindly
invite any interested parties to help contribute towards this software's development.

The web system is a 'derived' version of UberCMS. Any existing code has been reused,
rewritten or removed. The software overall has been worked on to provide a restored,
functional and extensible platform for everybody to use.

If you use any portion(s) of the source code, please remember to do so
under the terms of the license (see 'LICENSE' file in repository root).

We would like to extend our thanks to all contributers and supporters
of this project.
